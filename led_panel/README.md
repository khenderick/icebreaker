# The LED panel PMOD

Code to play around with the LED panel PMOD. 

### Panels

These are the "dumb" type of panels. It holds a bunch of shift registers and needs raw speed to get the pixels light up at once.

It's working with a cheap-ass P10 32x16 RGB panel from Aliexpress, and seems to be working with the 64x64 panel from the iCEBreaker FPGA CrowdSupply campaign. 

I'm focussing on the 32x16 panel for now, your mileage may vary.
