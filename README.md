# iCEBreaker FPGA experiments

This repo contains experiments with the iCEBreaker FPGA by @1bitsquared. 

### Contributions

This code currently holds my experiments with the FPGA so it's probably not that usefull. However,
if you would actually be checking out this repo and think I'm doing stuff incorrectly, please let
me know.

### License

All code in this repo is available under MIT. However, a lot of code here is so simple it's not
copyrightable anyway. I wonder in how many ways a clock divider can be written?
